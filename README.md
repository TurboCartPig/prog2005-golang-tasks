# Go Tasks

Programming tasks 1 and 2 for learning Go

# How to do stuff?

* Use `golangci-lint` for linting and stylechecking
* Test everything with `go test`

## Structure

The packages are pretty random since part of the tasks was just to make some, and use them.

```
go-tasks/
	basics/ 	  - The basic tasks
	cmd/ 		  - Various cli apps for testing
	fibandfact/   - Made up package for the sake of it
	intermediate/ - The intermediate tasks
```
