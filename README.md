# Go Tasks

Various tasks for learning go

# How to do stuff?

* Use `golangci-lint` for linting and stylechecking
* Test everything with `go test`

## Structure

The packages are pretty random since part of the tasks was just to make some, and use them.

```
go-tasks/
	basics/ 	- The basic tasks
	cmd/ 		- Various cli apps for testing
	fibandfact/ - Made up package for the sake of it
```
